# eShop Application
##### The eShop application is currently being developed with a focus on user convenience. It will allow users to search for products, add them to their cart, and place orders securely. The admin will have the ability to manage the product database with CRUD operations. The payment process will be handled by a dedicated microservice, and the application will feature a visually appealing web interface with a user-friendly UI/UX design.
